Project 3 Abstract
Domain: Weather Forecasting
Selected Techniques: Neural Networks and Principal Component Analysis 

Design:
	Our project will feature artificial neural networks and PCA in an attempt to create an intelligent agent that would be able to predict the weather forecast for a variety of time lengths. The techniques used will be displayed in the form of an interactive GUI, where users would be able to adjust the prediction length (days, weeks, month). Other selected technologies may be used to assist in the design, data collection, and display of the results. One such resource that may be used is the Forecast.io API. 


Implementation:
	For our implementation, we plan to use Java to create an artificial neural network (ANN).  We chose to use Java for this project as it is inherently object-oriented, an aspect we believe will benefit the design of the neural network.  Each neuron in the network can be represented by an object, with all neurons in the network connected by links (similar to a map structure).  Methods will be defined within the neuron object to apply the various modifications such as the summing function.  Principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced into the system to reduce the amount of working dimensions that the ANN has to consider.  This will simplify the ANN and improve the efficiency and accuracy of the system.
